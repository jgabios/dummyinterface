==============
Ethereum javascript interface and how it can be used in simple webpages.
In Alethzero client [ https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/ ] , there is a browser [ qt-webkit ]
that allows you to navigate the web, and those web pages you see will have access to an "eth" object
that is attached to "window" object.
You can see the methods available on "eth" object here:
